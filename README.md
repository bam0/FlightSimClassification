# FlightSimClassification

This project addresses the U.S. Air Force's need for enhanced pilot training efficiency by employing machine learning and deep learning techniques to classify flight simulation data. Leveraging a rich dataset from Dr. Jeremy Kepner of the MIT Lincoln Laboratory, we aim to accurately identify and categorize flight maneuvers recorded in TSV and PNG formats as 'good' or 'bad'. By developing a model that can process approximately 6,500 unique flight simulations, this project not only seeks to refine the training of student pilots using the T-6A Texan II simulator but also aims to support ongoing innovations in flight instruction through AI-enhancement in collaboration with the MIT AI Accelerator program. The project is structured in three phases: data cleaning and feature extraction, machine learning modeling, and image classification utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs). By effectively distinguishing between proficient and faulty flight simulations, we can better equip the USAF in their mission to produce capable pilots and mitigate the ongoing pilot shortage.
